- **Alert ID**: 48d9f5ee
- **Confidence**: 82%
- **Validity**: 83%

## Problem Pattern
VALIDATED CLAIMS:
* The S3 object metadata contains a flag indicating that a schema change was injected

## Investigation Path
1. get_s3_object
2. get_cloudwatch_logs
3. inspect_s3_object

## Root Cause
VALIDATED CLAIMS:
* The S3 object metadata contains a flag indicating that a schema change was injected. [evidence: s3_metadata]
* The S3 audit payload shows that the pipeline ingested data from an external API, and the API response included a note about a breaking schema change. [evidence: s3_audit]
* The S3 object sample data does not contain a "customer_id" field, which was likely a required field in the previous schema. [evidence: s3_metadata, s3_audit]
* NON_

NON-VALIDATED CLAIMS:
* The pipeline likely failed because the downstream steps (inspect_s3_object, get_s3_object, inspect_lambda_function) were unable to handle the schema change, as they were designed for the previous schema.
* The external API may have removed or changed the "customer_id" field, which was a required input for the downstream pipeline steps.

*Conclusion*

*Validated Claims (Supported by Evidence):*
• The S3 object metadata contains a flag indicating that a schema change was injected. [evidence: s3_metadata] [Evidence: s3_metadata, s3_metadata]
• The S3 audit payload shows that the pipeline ingested data from an external API, and the API response included a note about a breaking schema change. [evidence: s3_audit] [Evidence: s3_metadata, s3_metadata, vendor_audit, s3_audit]
• The S3 object sample data does not contain a "customer_id" field, which was likely a required field in the previous schema. [evidence: s3_metadata, s3_audit] [Evidence: s3_metadata, s3_metadata, s3_audit]
• The external API may have removed or changed the "customer_id" field, which was a required input for the downstream pipeline steps. [Evidence: vendor_audit]


*Non-Validated Claims (Inferred):*
• The pipeline likely failed because the downstream steps (inspect_s3_object, get_s3_object, inspect_lambda_function) were unable to handle the schema change, as they were designed for the previous schema.
