- **Pipeline**: upstream_downstream_pipeline_prefect
- **Alert ID**: d7f711da
- **Confidence**: 92%
- **Validity**: 100%

## Problem Pattern
VALIDATED CLAIMS:
* The S3 object metadata contains a note indicating a "BREAKING: customer_id field removed in v2

## Investigation Path
1. get_s3_object
2. get_cloudwatch_logs
3. inspect_s3_object

## Root Cause
VALIDATED CLAIMS:
* The S3 object metadata contains a note indicating a "BREAKING: customer_id field removed in v2.0" schema change. [evidence: s3_metadata]
* The S3 audit payload shows that the Prefect flow interacted with an external API endpoint that returned a response with the updated schema, including the removal of the "customer_id" field. [evidence: s3_audit]
* NON_

NON-VALIDATED CLAIMS:
* The Prefect flow may have been designed to expect the "customer_id" field, and the removal of this field in the API response likely caused the flow to fail.
* Without access to the Prefect flow code or configuration, it's unclear how the external API schema change was propagated downstream to cause the pipeline failure.
